# Simple Brainstorm

A lightweight brainstorming skill for quick ideation and decision-making. Get from idea to actionable plan in minutes, not hours.

## Hard Gate

Do NOT write any code or take any implementation action until the user approves a direction.

## Process

1. **Understand**: Read project context. Ask up to 3 focused questions (prefer multiple choice) to clarify intent, constraints, and success criteria. Combine related questions when possible.

2. **Propose**: Present 2 approaches with clear trade-offs. Lead with your recommendation and explain why. Keep each approach to 2-3 sentences.

3. **Decide**: Get user approval on an approach. If rejected, propose alternatives. Don't loop more than twice — if still unclear, ask the user to clarify what they want directly.

4. **Summarize**: Write a brief summary of the chosen approach (what, why, key decisions) as a comment at the top of the first file you create, or share it in chat. No separate design doc needed.

## Principles

- **Speed over ceremony**: Skip formality. No design docs for small/medium work.
- **YAGNI ruthlessly**: Only design what's needed now.
- **Bias toward action**: When two options are close, pick one and move. Perfect is the enemy of done.
- **One round of questions**: Batch your clarifying questions. Don't drag out discovery.
- **Scale to complexity**: For trivial tasks, steps 1-2 can be a single message. For larger work, spend more time on step 2.
